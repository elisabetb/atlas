Expression Atlas Heatmap
========================

Heatmap visualization of baseline, proteomics baseline and differential gene expression experiments for [Expression 
Atlas](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa).

It has four basic visualizations:
* Multiexperiment: collapses several baseline tissue experiments into a single table
* Baseline: displays a single baseline expression experiment
* Proteomics baseline: displays a single proteomics baseline expression experiment
* Differential: displays a single differential expression experiment

Visualizations include, where available, an anatomogram to the left of the table.
