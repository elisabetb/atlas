RNA was isolated from neurospheres cultured from p107-/- embryos and their wildtype littermates. P107 knockout mice have previously been shown to have an increased number of stem cells and enhanced stem cell self renewal. With the microarray experiment we are hoping to discover the genes involved in stem cell number and self renewal along with p107 Analysis requested:   Compare against p107 knockout Littermates Estimated purity:    minimal non-neural contamination RNA concentration:   2 ug/uL Num cells for RNA prep:   15 x 10^6 Sample volume:    10 uL	P-G3779-1	P-G3779-3	GSE3779GSM86665 sample	P-G3779-2	GSE3779GSM86665 extract	total_RNA	GSE3779GSM86665 LE.biotin	biotin	synthetic_RNA	Affymetrix:Protocol:Hybridization-EukGE-WS2v4	"9859-11, chip MOE430A"	A-AFFY-23	P-AFFY-6	"9859-11, chip MOE430A"	GSM86665.CEL	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-3779/E-GEOD-3779.raw.1.zip	E-GEOD-3779-processed-data-1559575756.txt	ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/experiment/GEOD/E-GEOD-3779/E-GEOD-3779.processed.1.zip	wild type
